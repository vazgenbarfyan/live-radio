## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of Live Radio on your
local machine by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vazgenbarfyan/live-radio.git
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `yarn start`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/build` folder. As soon as the initial build completes, it will start the
Node.js server (`node build/server.js`).

Now you can open our web app in a browser, on mobile devices and view it. Note that the template used is flatlogic's [template](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard). Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

For more info please refer to [getting started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide to download and run the project (Node.js >= 6.5)
